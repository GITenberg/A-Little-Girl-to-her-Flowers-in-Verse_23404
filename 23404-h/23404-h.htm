DAISY.</h2>

This little Daisy we all love,<br />

<h2>PRIMROSE.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

This is a pretty Primrose,<br />
In shady lanes it grows;<br />
And early in the pleasant spring,<br />
In gardens too it blows.<br />

<h2>DAFFODIL.</h2>

<h2>VIOLET.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
How I do love the Violet!<br />
Of all the flow&#8217;rs it is my pet;<br />
How snug it hides its little head<br />
In the green leaves of its low bed.<br />

<p>
Lowly Lily of the Vale,<br />

You say, &#8220;Be pretty as you will,<br />
Yet modesty is lovelier still.&#8212;<br />

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
&#8220;Forget me not:&#8221; no, lovely flow&#8217;r,<br />
I&#8217;ll think on thee for many an hour:<br />
If I could paint, I&#8217;d copy thee;<br />

<h2>TULIP.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
The Tulip, with its varied hues<br />

(Tho&#8217; scentless,) splendid you appear,<br />
When thickly set in rich parterre.<br />
</p>

<h2>ROSE.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

With jess&#8217;mine in the bower.<br />

<h2>SUNFLOWER.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
I don&#8217;t admire the Sunflower,<br />
It rears its head so high;<br />
And looks so proud, and seems to say,<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m climbing to the sky.&#8221;<br />
</p>

<h2>FIELD-FLOWERS.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
But oh! the fields they are so sweet,<br />
The gardens are so gay,<br />
That I should like to run about,<br />
And nosegays make all day.<br />
</p>

<h2>GREEN-HOUSE.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
And now we&#8217;ll see the Green-house Plants:<br />
They cannot bear cold air;<br />
Yet with them many wild field-flowr&#8217;s<br />
In beauty may compare.<br />
</p>

<h2>MYRTLES AND GERANIUMS.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
The Myrtles and Geraniums<br />
Seem mostly to abound;<br />
And these, in the warm summer months,<br />
Are planted in the ground.<br />
</p>






<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>

<h2>CAMELLIA JAPONICA.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
Here are the rich Camellias;<br />
Oh, &#8217;tis a splendid sight!<br />
Some variegated with soft tints,<br />
Some crimson, and some white.<br />
</p>

<h2>PASSION-FLOWER.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
How gracefully the Passion-flow&#8217;r,<br />
Along the trellis twining,<br />
Shows symmetry, with colours fair,<br />
So pleasingly combining.<br />
</p>






<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

<h2>ORANGES.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
The Oranges, and Lemons too,<br />
All in their proper station,<br />
Tho&#8217; robb&#8217;d of half their native charms,<br />
Invite our admiration.<br />

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>
But tell me now, who made these flow&#8217;rs,<br />
Who moulded them so fair;<br />
Who taught them, with such rich perfume,<br />
To scent the morning air.<br />
<br />
Who fill&#8217;d their cups with drops of dew,<br />
When parch&#8217;d with summer&#8217;s rays;<br />
Who tinged their leaves with brightest hue,<br />
On which we wondering gaze.<br />
<br />
Can <i>man</i> such splendid dyes produce?<br />
Can he such colours blend?<br />
Can he the tendril graceful twine,<br />
Or the soft branches bend?<br />
<br />
Oh no! &#8217;tis God, who reigns on high,<br />
Who form&#8217;d the earth and heaven;<br />
Who framed each star that lights the sky.<br />
He hath to mortals given<br />
<br />
All these, and more! And should not we,<br />
Frail children of mortality,<br />
With thankful hearts, each day, each night,<br />
Think of his goodness infinite?<br />
<br />
And pray, that gratitude may still<br />
Our stubborn hearts with rapture fill?<br />
O teach us humbly to adore<br />
Thee first, Thee last, Thee evermore!<br />

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
